In Memory of CODE BLUE

Even though he is no longer with us, his work will be enjoyed for years on and the knowledge he has taught us will stay with us forever. Though we didn't see eye to eye, I applaud the work you have done for this community, and enjoyed the projects we shared, however shortlived they may have been.
